# Venmito Data Science Project

## Introduction

*Welcome to Xtillion's Data Engineering Project. For this exercise, we will simulate a client interaction where you are an engineering consultant for Venmito, your client. We're excited to see how you tackle this challenge and provide us with a solution that can bring together disparate data sources into an insightful and valuable resource.* 

We are Venmito, a modest payments startup focused on making it easy for our customers to transfer funds, shop at participating local stores, and enjoy personalized promotions tailored just for them. As our popularity has steadily grown, so has the volume and complexity of our data. Unfortunately, this sustained growth has overwhelmed our original data systems, and we now find ourselves with a setup that's no longer sustainable.

**That's where you come in**. Your mission is to unravel and consolidate our fragmented data into a scalable, insightful, and consumable solution. We're counting on your technical skills, creativity, and resourcefulness to guide us from data chaos to clarity, enabling smarter decisions and continued growth.

We have five data files available:

- people.json
- people.yml
- transfers.csv
- transactions.xml
- promotions.csv

These files contain information about our customers, transactions, transfers, or promotions.

Your task is to develop a solution that reads, unifies, and structures our data into a consumable format. Additionally, we would like you to analyze this data and provide clear, actionable insights based solely on your findings. These insights should help us better understand our customers, improve our processes, and make informed, data-driven decisions going forward. Using data-driven techniques, your main goal is to propose a strategy or solution for Venmito that improves customer engagement by increasing promotion responses and encouraging ongoing customer activity.

## Requirements

1. **Data Ingestion**: Your solution should be able to read and load data from all the provided files. Take into account that these files are in different formats (JSON, YAML, CSV, XML).

2. **Data Matching and Conforming**: Once the data is loaded, your solution should be capable of matching and conforming the data across these files. This includes identifying common entities, resolving inconsistencies, and organizing the data into a unified format. Furthermore, the consolidated data should not only be transient but also persistent. This persistence should be achieved using appropriate methods such as storing in a file, database, or other suitable data storage solutions, and not restricted to just a variable in memory. This way, the integrity and availability of the consolidated data are ensured for future use and analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**
Your solution should process the conformed data to derive actionable insights that support improving customer engagement. The focus should be on identifying the factors that influence promotion response rates and sustained customer activity. This includes performing aggregations, statistical analyses, and applying predictive or clustering models to uncover meaningful trends in client and transaction behavior.
Key areas of exploration may include (but are not limited to):

Which customer segments are most or least responsive to specific types of promotions?
How can we personalize promotions to increase response rates?

4. **Code**: The code for your solution should be well-structured and comprehensible, with comments included where necessary. Remember, the quality and readability of the code will be a significant factor in the evaluation of the final deliverable.

Note: The examples provided in these requirements are purely illustrative. You are free to employ any solution or technology you deem fit for fulfilling these requirements

## Deliverables

1. Source code.
2. A README file with your name, email, a description of your solution, your design decisions, and clear instructions on how to run your code.
3. A method to consume the reorganized and analyzed data.

## Instructions for Submission

1. Complete your project as described above in a branch within your fork.
2. Write a detailed README file with your name, email, a description explaining your approach, the technologies you used, and provides clear instructions on how to run your code.
3. Submit your project by uploading a zip file to the provided URL.

We look forward to seeing your solution!

Thank you,

Venmito
